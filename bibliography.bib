abstract="In 1933, in a paper titled Die Massbegriff der Theorie der Kontinuierlichen Gruppen published in the Annals of Mathematics (Volume 34, Number 2), A. Haar established the existence of a translation invariant measure in compact, separable, topological groups. Translation invariance of a measure $\mu$ in a topological group G means that if E is a measurable set then $\mu$(E + x) = $\mu$(E) for each x ∈ G. Here, E + x = {\{}y ∈ G | y = a + x for some a ∈ G{\}}. E + x is called the x-translate of E. The transformation Txdefined on G by Tx(y) = y + x is called the x-translation or simply a translation. Topological groups will be defined later in the chapter and these concepts will be developed formally.",
